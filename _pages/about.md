I am a Ph.D. student of Biomedical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Guang-Zhong Yang](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/Keynote_Speaker/3049.html) and [Prof. Yun Gu](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/en/po_facultyv/531.html). My research interest lies at surgical robotics, robotics vision, and medical image analysis. I am particularly interested in the endoluminal navigation algorithms. 

I received my B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have worked as a research intern with Prof. Alan Yuille at the Johns Hopkins University; Prof. Cihang Xie at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Prof. Guoyan Zheng at the Institude of Medical Robotics.

My resume can be downloaded through this link [CV](https://github.com/jywu511/jywu511.github.io/blob/master/_CV/CV_Junyang%20Wu.pdf).
