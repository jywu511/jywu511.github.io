I am a 'zero-year' Ph.D. student of Biomedical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Guangzhong Yang. My research interest lies at medical image analysis, surgical robotics, and computer vision. I am particularly interested in Navigation of pulmonary interventional robot in the bronchus. 

I received my B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have worked as a research intern with Prof. Alan Yuille at the Johns Hopkins University; Prof. Cihang Xie at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Prof. Guoyan Zheng at the Institude of Medical Robotics. I receive the 2020 National Scholarship.

This is my [CV](http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper3.pdf)
